    <string name="objective">Objective: find as much rhyme words as possible
        within the specified time. Only perfect rhymes count.
        Each word will give you a specific amount of points.
        Better rhyme words will give more points. \n \n
        FYI, the time frames are: \n
        Easy: 70 sec \n
        Medium: 60 sec \n
        Hard: 50 sec \n
        Insane: 40 sec \n
        Random: 60 sec \n \n
        Also, the words will keep getting harder. Do you got what it takes
        to become the next rhyme master? Good luck!
